This project visualizes earthquake data from United States Geological Survey.

The USGS GeoJson data can be accessed here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
Information is updated every minute, and is organized into different datasets by time and severity.   

This project reads in data from all earthquakes in the past day.
